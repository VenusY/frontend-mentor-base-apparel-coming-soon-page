# frontend-mentor-base-apparel-coming-soon-page
Solution to the Frontend Mentor Base Apparel coming soon page challenge using HTML, SCSS, and JS.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

Page layout was created using CSS flexbox and the position property.

## What I learned

Inline elements, such as <img> tags, have whitespace by default. To remove this whitespace, you can either set the display property to block or set the font size to 0.


To use media queries in JavaScript, you can use the ```.matchMedia()``` method, along with the ```matches()``` method.

```js
const desktopMediaQuery = window.matchMedia("(min-width: 1440px)");

if (desktopMediaQuery.matches) {
    form.style.borderWidth = "2px";
    btnContainer.style.minWidth = "96px";
}
```
